# leuro-m20-bbb

Hardware interface to Leurocomm M20 using 
Beaglebone Black mmap'ed GPIO with a cavalier approach.

## Overview

leuro-m20-bbb reads framebuffer updates (see related project 
[caprica](https://github.com/ndf-zz/caprica)
) sent over a Unix domain socket, then writes the framebuffer
to an attached Leurocomm M20 monochrome LED display by bit-banging
GPIO pins on a Beaglebone Black. In order to achieve acceptable
refresh times, GPIO set and clear registers are written directly
using mmap-ed pages from /dev/mem.

## Building

Edit the socket, screen configuration, and UID/GID defines
then compile leuro-m20-bbb using make:

	$ make
	cc -Wall -Werror -O3 leuro-m20-bbb.c -o leuro-m20-bbb

## Running

First run the provided script pinsetup.h (or an equivalent process)
to configure GPIO and PWM settings on the relevant Beaglebone Black
pins. Then, as root, run leuro-m20-bbb:

	$ ./pinsetup.sh
	$ sudo ./leuro-m20-bbb

## Hardware Setup

Connect from the Beaglebone Black
P9 expansion header through a ~500 Ohm resistor[1] to the 
non-inverting inputs[2] on the "LED-ADAPTER-KARTE" or directly
to the "LED-OPTO-KARTE". Inverting inputs can be tied together
and connected to a ground pin (eg P9.1, P9.2) or run separately
back to a ground point on the Beaglebone Black. If the display
has a "LEDDIMMER" board, remove it and the connecting ribbon
completely.

   - [1] On the "LED-OPTO-KARTE" board, A2231 optocouplers
     decode balanced lines from a Leurocomm PCI card through a
     220 Ohm series resistor. To get the recommended
     2.5 mA "ON" current from a Beaglebone Black 3.3V GPIO pin,
     an additional ~500 Ohm series resistor is required on each input.

   - [2] Balanced inputs are labeled X/XN where X is the inverting input,
     and XN is the non-inverting input. X connects to the A2231
     cathode, XN connects to the anode. For more information on the
     A2231, see the
     [manufacturer website](https://www.broadcom.com/products/optocouplers/industrial-plastic/digital-optocouplers/5mbd/hcpl-2231).

## Display Mapping

![Display Arrangement](display_mapping.svg "Display Mapping")

Leurocomm displays (viewed from the front-side) are arranged in rows
of LED panels labeled "LED - M20CC" (12x12 pixels in this case),
daisy-chained right to left. Each LED panel has two shift registers
"a" and "b", arranged in 6 rows of 3 columns, each 4 bits wide.
Groups of 3 or 4 LED panel rows are driven from interface cards
labeled "4fach-Verteiler PCI IO -VM2003".
Interface cards are on the right side of the display, connected in a
daisy-chain from bottom to top. Each collection of rows, numbered 1-4
on the interface card, is connected top to bottom.
Framebuffer updates from caprica describe the desired image as a buffer
of 32 bit pixel values packed little-endian[3] from left to right,
top to bottom.

   * [3] Beaglebone Black typically runs little-endian
